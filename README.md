# GSTChain - no more tax evasion

In a report of Financial Express it is found that the central GST authorities have detected evasion of Rs 70,206 crore between July 1, 2017 launch of GST and January, 2020. So our project aims to solve this problem using a decentralised blockchain system.

### Checkout the deployed site [here](https://gstchain.web.app/).

### Youtube video of the working is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4eHxIrYQ70).

# How this works
This system works between government and business.
## For government
- The government official receives GST every time a bill is generated by a registered business.
- Businesses cannot evade taxes, as data of each bill is stored in the blockchain, as soon as it is generated.
- Government officials can login and check every billing and business details through portal.
## For businesses
- Business officials can register, and login using their unique GST numbers.
- The bills they generate will automatically contribute towards GST generation.
- Every business is registered in blockchain.
